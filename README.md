# MERN stack infrastructure
I've set up this MERN stack, as a foundational template to bootstrap infrastructure. It is designed to be reused for future projects, providing a structured starting point for setting up infrastructure code. By cloning this repository, developers can quickly initiate new projects with a consistent and organized foundation, saving time and ensuring best practices are followed. 

# Key features
- Frontend: Signup & login components, forms, pages 
- Middleware: Utilities modules, JWT authentication 
- Backend: Server.js → Routes → Controllers → Model/Schema
